                                        <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for <strong>loading coils</strong>, archaically called
                                                <strong>"Pupin coils"</strong>, followed closely on the pioneering work
                                                of the English physicist and applied mathematician Oliver Heaviside,
                                                which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the
                                                patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by
                                                American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T
                                                bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had
                                                their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this
                                                point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent.
                                                <strong>AT&T</strong> were afraid they would lose control of an
                                                invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly
                                                extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine
                                                ones.</p>
