                <p><strong>Mihajlo Pupin, Ph.D., LL.D.</strong> (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски
                    Пупин, pronounced [miˈxǎjlo ˈîdʋoɾski ˈpǔpin]; 9 October 1858[3][4] – 12 March
                    1935), also known as Michael I. Pupin was a <strong>Serbian American physicist,
                            physical chemist, philanthropist and patriot</strong>. Pupin is best
                    known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range
                    of long-distance telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at
                    predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire (known as "pupinization").
                </p>

                <p>Pupin was a founding member of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/"
                            target="_blank">National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA)</a>
                    on 3 March 1915, which later became NASA.[5] In 1924, he won a Pulitzer Prize
                    for his autobiography. Pupin was elected president or vice-president of the
                    highest scientific and technical institutions, such as the American Institute of
                    Electrical Engineers, the New York Academy of Sciences, the Radio Institute of
                    America, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was
                    also a honorary consul of Serbia in the United States from 1912 to 1920 and
                    played a role in determining the borders of newly formed Kingdom of Yugoslavia.
